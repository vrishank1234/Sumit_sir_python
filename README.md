Program1 - Write a Python program to create a person class. Include attributes like name, country and date of birth. Implement a method to determine the person's age.

Program2 - Write a Python program to create a class representing a stack data structure. Include methods for pushing and popping elements.

Program3 - Write a Python program to create a class representing a shopping cart. Include methods for adding and removing items, and calculating the total price.

Program4 - Write a Python program to create a class representing a bank. Include methods formanaging customer accounts and transactions.

Program5 - Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.

Program6 - Define a class attribute “color” with a default value white. i.e., Every Vehicle should be white.

Program7 - Implement a class inheritance as following: class shoe, class converse(shoe), class combatboot(shoe), class sandal(shoe)

Program8 - Create a Python class called “Car” with attributes like make, model, and year. Then, create an object of the “Car” class and print its details.

Program9 - Create a base class called “Animal” and two subclasses, “Dog” and “Cat.” Add methods and attributes specific to each subclass.

Program10 - Create three classes, “Person,” “Employee,” and “Student.” Use multiple inheritance to create a class “PersonInfo” that inherits from both “Employee” and “Student.” Add attributes and methods specific to each class.

Program11 - Create a base class called “Vehicle” with a method called “drive.” Implement two subclasses, “Car” and “Bicycle,” that inherit from “Vehicle” and override the “drive” method with their own implementations.

Program12 - 12. Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

Program13 - Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.

Program14 - To find the Euclidean distance between two points in a two dimensional space using class and object
